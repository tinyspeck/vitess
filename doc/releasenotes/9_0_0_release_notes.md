This release complies with VEP-3 which removes the upgrade order requirement. Components can be upgraded in any order. It is recommended that the upgrade order should still be followed if possible, except to canary test the new version of VTGate before upgrading the rest of the components.

## Incompatible Changes

The following PRs made changes to behaviors that clients might rely on. They should be reviewed carefully so that client code can be changed in concert with a Vitess release deployment.
* The update to golang 1.15 (#7204) might break systems that use TLS certificates with a common name. A fix is documented here (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40748#issuecomment-673612108)

Vitess 9.0 is not compatible with the previous release of the Vitess Kubernetes Operator (2.2.0). A new version of the Operator (2.3.0) is available that is compatible.

### Set Statement Support 

Set statement support has been added in Vitess. There are [some system variables](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/sysvars/sysvars.go#L147,L190) which are disabled by default and can be enabled using flag `-enable_system_settings` on VTGate. These system variables are set on the mysql server. Because they change the mysql session, using them leads to the Vitess connection no longer using the connection pool and forcing dedicated connections.
